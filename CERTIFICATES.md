# Requesting certificates to sign your app

*This guide assumes you have an active developer account. If this is not the case, you can visit the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) page, and click on Enroll. Applying costs $100 per year.*

Apps on the Mac App Store are signed. A few words about it ([source](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Security/Conceptual/CodeSigningGuide/Introduction/Introduction.html)):

> Code signing is a security technology, used in OS X, that allows you to certify that an app was created by you.
> Once an app is signed, the system can detect any change to the appâ€”whether the change is introduced accidentally or by malicious code.

To sign your app, you will need to have two certificates installed on your machine.

* A **Mac App Distribution** certificate - used to sign the `.app` file
* A **Mac Installer Distribution** certificate - used to sign the `.pkg` file that will be uploaded to the MAS

### Preparing the request

To request your certificates you need a `.certSigningRequest` file.

Open `/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app`; in the app menu, and select *Request a Certificate From A Certificate Authority...*:

Fill the needed informations in the assistant:

1. Your email address
2. The name of the certificate
3. The *CA Email* field tells it is required, but you have to leave it blank

Save the file on the disk. Its name is `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest`.

### Generating the certificates from the Apple Member Center

Login to the [Member Center](https://developer.apple.com/membercenter), and go to the *Certificates, Identifiers & Profiles* page, which looks like this:

In the *Mac Apps > Certificates* page, click on the **+** button to add a new *Mac App Store certificate*:

Then, select *Mac App Distribution*:

Upload your `CertificateSigningRequest.certSigningRequest` file, when asked:

Finally, download the generated certificate on your machine:

Then, you have to renew those steps, by selecting *Mac Installer Distribution* instead of *Mac App Distribution*, on the concerned step.

### Installing the certificates

When both certificates have been downloaded, you have to import them in **Keychain Access**, by double-clicking on them.

The installed certificates look like this:

Save the string in parenthesis (beginning with `LK7` on the capture).

When signing the app, we will refer to it as the **identity**.
